* This is the top-level module for a RISC-V processor implementation.
* It integrates the control unit, ALU control unit, and datapath to form a complete processor. The module coordinates the operations of various submodules to execute RISC-V instructions, handle memory operations, and perform arithmetic and logical computations. 

## Datapath

* The Datapath module is responsible for implementing the core data flow of the processor. 
* It manages the Program Counter (PC), performs arithmetic and logical operations, handles instructions and memory operations, and coordinates between registers, ALU, and memory.
