![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee9b39a0-d539-4499-b393-e7938ab97b6c)
* This is the top-level module for a RISC-V processor implementation.
* It integrates the control unit, ALU control unit, and datapath to form a complete processor. The module coordinates the operations of various submodules to execute RISC-V instructions, handle memory operations, and perform arithmetic and logical computations.
