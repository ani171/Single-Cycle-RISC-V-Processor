# Single-Cycle-RISC-V-Processor
This repository contains a single-cycle RISC-V processor designed in SystemVerilog for a 5th-semester project. It supports a subset of the RISC-V ISA and executes one instruction per clock cycle. The project includes SystemVerilog source files, testbenches, and documentation, providing a complete implementation ready for synthesis and simulation.
